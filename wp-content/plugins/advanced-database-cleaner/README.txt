Clean database by deleting orphaned data such as 'revisions', 'expired transients', optimize database and more...

== Description ==

Advanced Database Cleaner is a complete WordPress optimization plugin that helps you clean up database clutter and optimize database performance by removing unused data such as old revisions, auto drafts, spam comments, expired transients, unused post meta, duplicated post meta, unused user meta, etc. 

It is designed to help you improve website speed by reducing database bloat and ensuring a lean, efficient WordPress installation. It also provides detailed previews, powerful filters, and automation tools to safely control what gets cleaned. 

With the ✨[**Premium version**](https://sigmaplugin.com/downloads/wordpress-advanced-database-cleaner/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=wordpress&utm_content=landing_page)✨, you can unlock even more advanced features, such as detecting and cleaning orphaned options, orphaned tables, orphaned post meta, orphaned user meta, orphaned transients, and orphaned cron jobs. It also gives you clear insights into how your database evolves over time through built-in analytics, lets you monitor plugin and theme activity to better understand when new data is created or when leftovers appear, and much more.

### Why use Advanced Database Cleaner❓

👉 **Get a clear overview**: see how many tables, options, transients, cron jobs, metadata... records you have, and identify which are unused or orphaned.

👉 **Save time**: configure what to clean, how far back to keep data, and how often to run automations. The plugin will then handle recurring cleanups for you.

👉 **Save space and improve performance**: removing unnecessary data reduces database size, makes backups faster, and can improve query performance, especially on busy or older sites.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why should I "clean my database"? =
As you use WordPress, your database accumulates a large amount of unnecessary data such as revisions, spam comments, trashed comments, and more. This clutter slowly increases the size of your database, which can make your site slower and make backups take longer. Cleaning this data keeps your site lighter, faster, and easier to maintain.

= Is it safe to clean my database? =
Yes, it is safe. The plugin does not run any code that can break your site or delete posts, pages, or approved comments. It only removes items that WordPress considers unnecessary. However, you should always back up your database before performing any cleanup. This is required, not optional! Backups ensure you can always restore your site if something unexpected happens.

= Why should I "optimize my database"? =
Optimizing your database reclaims unused space and reorganizes the way data is stored inside your tables. Over time, tables become fragmented, especially on active websites. Optimization reduces storage usage and improves the speed at which your database responds. This process is safe and can significantly improve performance on large or busy websites.

= Is it safe to clean the cron (scheduled tasks)? =
Cron jobs allow WordPress and plugins to run tasks automatically (like checking for updates or sending emails). When a plugin is removed, some of its cron jobs may remain behind. These leftover tasks serve no purpose and can slow down wp-cron events. Cleaning unnecessary cron jobs is safe as long as you know which ones should be removed. If you are unsure, it is safer not to delete any cron jobs manually.

= What are "revisions"? What SQL code is used to clean them? =
WordPress stores revisions for each saved draft or update so you can review older versions. Over time, these accumulate and take up space.  
SQL used by the plugin to delete revisions:  
`DELETE FROM posts WHERE post_type = 'revision'`

= What are "auto drafts"? What SQL code is used to clean them? =
WordPress automatically creates auto-drafts while you are editing posts/pages. If those drafts are never published, they remain in the database.  
SQL used by the plugin to delete auto-drafts:  
`DELETE FROM posts WHERE post_status = 'auto-draft'`

= What are "pending comments"? What SQL code is used to clean them? =
Pending comments are comments waiting for your approval. If you have many bots submitting comments, this list can grow quickly.  
SQL used by the plugin to delete pending comments:  
`DELETE FROM comments WHERE comment_approved = '0'`

= What are "spam comments"? What SQL code is used to clean them? =
Spam comments are comments flagged as spam by you or by an anti-spam plugin. They can safely be deleted.  
SQL used by the plugin to delete spam comments:  
`DELETE FROM comments WHERE comment_approved = 'spam'`

= What are "trash comments"? What SQL code is used to clean them? =
Trash comments are deleted comments moved to the trash. They are no longer visible and can be permanently removed.  
SQL used by the plugin to delete trash comments:  
`DELETE FROM comments WHERE comment_approved = 'trash'`

= What are "trackbacks"? What SQL code is used to clean them? =
Trackbacks are a legacy system used by WordPress to allow one website to notify another that it has linked to its content. When a site receives a trackback, it appears as a type of comment on the post. Because trackbacks can be sent manually, they became heavily abused by spammers who use them to post unwanted links on websites.
SQL used by the plugin to delete trackbacks:  
`DELETE FROM comments WHERE comment_type = 'trackback'`

= What are "pingbacks"? What SQL code is used to clean them? =
Pingbacks are an automated notification system used by WordPress. When one website publishes a link to another site’s post, WordPress sends a pingback request to the linked site. If accepted, the pingback appears as a type of comment, confirming that another site has referenced your content. Because pingbacks are automated, they are often exploited by bots to generate spam requests. 
SQL used by the plugin to delete pingbacks:  
`DELETE FROM comments WHERE comment_type = 'pingback'`

= What is "unused post meta"? What SQL code is used to clean it? =
Post meta stores additional information for posts. When a post is deleted, some metadata may be left behind. This leftover "unused" data can grow over time.  
SQL used by the plugin to delete unused post meta:  
`DELETE pm FROM postmeta pm LEFT JOIN posts wp ON wp.ID = pm.post_id WHERE wp.ID IS NULL`

= What is "unused comment meta"? What SQL code is used to clean it? =
Comment meta stores extra information for comments. When a comment is removed, some metadata may remain in the database.  
SQL used by the plugin to delete unused comment meta:  
`DELETE FROM commentmeta WHERE comment_id NOT IN (SELECT comment_ID FROM comments)`

= What is "unused user meta"? What SQL code is used to clean it? =

Not yet. The plugin is not currently compatible with SharDB, HyperDB, or Multi-DB setups. Support may be added in future versions.
